# Hotel-Reservation-System
This hotel reservation system project is the culmination of my learning from the BCA 4th semester, representing my first full-stack application. The system is designed to facilitate hotel room bookings and display room availability efficiently.

Features
Implemented Features:
User Registration and Authentication
Room Booking Functionality
Display of 'Booked' Badges on Reserved Rooms
In-App Notification System
Missing Features:
Email System (PHP Mailer file included but not implemented)
Payment Integration
Setup and Installation
Prerequisites:
XAMPP or any PHP server setup
MySQL Database (Database name: hbwebsite)
Steps to Set Up:
Clone the repository or download the code from https://github.com/pratikpz/Hotel-Reservation-System
Place the codebase in the root directory of your local server (e.g., htdocs folder in XAMPP).
Import the hbwebsite.sql file into your MySQL database.
Configure the database connection settings in config.php or relevant configuration file.
Ensure proper XAMPP or server configurations to avoid mailing issues (if implementing mailing system).
Usage
Start your local server (XAMPP or any PHP server).
Access the application through your web browser (e.g., http://localhost/hotel-reservation-system).
Register an account or log in if you already have one.
Browse available rooms, make bookings, and explore the functionalities.
Note:
The PHP Mailer file is included, but due to issues with XAMPP configuration, the mailing system hasn't been implemented. Suggestions to resolve this issue are highly appreciated.

For downloading the code and setting up the database:

Go to the GitHub repository or location where the code is hosted.
Click on the "Code" or "Download" button to get the codebase (either clone the repository using Git or download it as a ZIP file).
Once downloaded, extract the files and place them in the root directory of your local server (e.g., XAMPP's htdocs folder).
Import the provided hbwebsite.sql file into your MySQL database (you can use phpMyAdmin or MySQL command line).
Update the database connection settings in the configuration file (config.php or similar) to match your local setup (e.g., database name, username, password).
Following these steps should enable you to set up the project locally with the database and start exploring its functionalities.
